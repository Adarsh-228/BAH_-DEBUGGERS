## High-Level Architecture

The system will consist of the following main components:

1.  **Frontend (Cursor-like Interface):** A web-based user interface that mimics the look and feel of the Cursor IDE, providing a chat-like interaction for spatial analysis tasks. It will include a dedicated area for displaying maps and geoprocessing results.

2.  **Backend API:** A server-side application that handles requests from the frontend, orchestrates the LLM interactions, manages geoprocessing tasks, and serves map data.

3.  **Chain-of-Thought LLM Integration:** The core intelligence layer that interprets user queries, breaks down complex spatial analysis problems into sub-tasks, generates geoprocessing workflows, and provides explanations (chain-of-thought).

4.  **Geoprocessing Engine:** A component responsible for executing spatial analysis operations. This could involve integrating with existing GIS libraries or tools.

5.  **Map Service:** A component for rendering and interacting with maps, displaying spatial data, and visualizing analysis results.

## Technology Stack (Proposed)

*   **Frontend:** React.js (for interactive UI components) with a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS or Styled Components for Cursor-like styling. Map integration will use a library like Leaflet.js or Mapbox GL JS.
*   **Backend:** Python with Flask or FastAPI (for RESTful API). This will also host the LLM integration logic.
*   **LLM Integration:** Utilize a suitable LLM API (e.g., Google Gemini API, OpenAI GPT API) for chain-of-thought reasoning and task decomposition.
*   **Geoprocessing Engine:** Python libraries such as GeoPandas, Shapely, Fiona, Rasterio for spatial data manipulation and analysis. Potentially integrate with a more robust GIS engine like PostGIS or GDAL/OGR for complex operations.
*   **Map Service:** OpenStreetMap (OSM) data served via a tile server, or a commercial map service like Mapbox.
